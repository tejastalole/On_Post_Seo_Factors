# 🔑 On-Post SEO Factors

**1. Keywords in Caption**

   - Use relevant keywords naturally in your captions so your post shows up when people search.

   - Example: Instead of “Great workout today”, use “Full body home workout for beginners”.

---

**2. Alt Text (Image Description)**

   - Instagram lets you add alt text under Advanced Settings → Accessibility.

   - This helps both SEO and accessibility.

----

**3. Hashtags**

   - Use targeted, niche, and trending hashtags.

   - Avoid spammy or overly broad ones (#love, #instagood).

   - Mix branded, niche-specific, and community hashtags.

---

**4. Keywords in Image/Video File Name (before upload)**

   - Instagram doesn’t officially say it uses this, but naming your file vegan-smoothie-recipe.jpg is better than IMG1234.jpg.

**5. Location Tagging**

   - Adding a location increases chances of local discoverability.

## 📈 Engagement & Algorithm Signals

**6. Likes, Comments, Saves, Shares**

   - High engagement signals Instagram to boost your post visibility.

**7. Relevancy & Consistency**

   - Posting consistently around your niche strengthens SEO for related searches.

**8. Follower Interaction**

   - If your followers engage quickly, your post ranks better in Explore.

## 🌍 Profile & Account-Level SEO

**9. Optimized Bio**

  - Include keywords in your bio and name field (e.g., “Fitness Coach | Weight Loss Tips”).

**10. Username & Handle**

   - A keyword-relevant handle can help (e.g., @veganrecipesdaily instead of @foodlover123).
